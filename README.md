# Gesture-Recognition
The proposed system gives a recognition algorithm which recognize a set of six specific static hand gestures, namely, Pause, Play, Rewind, Restart, FF(Fast Forward), and None.

# Problem statement
The problem statement at hand is to recognize different hand gestures that are performed over a
real time webcam stream. The gesture images that are captured and stored are used to train and
build deep learning models. A real-time stream will be used to assess the model's ability to
recognize gestures
